# Titanic_Survival_Analysis
- The Titanic Survival Prediction System is designed to determine the likelihood of a person surviving the sinking of the Titanic based on various factors.
- This system considers key variables such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more to make predictions. By analyzing historical data and applying machine learning techniques, it can provide valuable insights into the factors that most likely lead to survival during this historic maritime disaster.
- This predictive model can assist in understanding the impact of different variables on survival rates and inform decision-making in similar scenarios.
